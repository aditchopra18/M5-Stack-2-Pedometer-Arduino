<h1 align="center">Pedometer - Steps, Maximum Acceleration, and Distance </h1>
## Introduction
● In a health conscious world like ours, a pedometer proves to be really helpful to track our health goals.\
● It provides a user a sense of the amount of work they have put in to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\
● Research has shown that diseases are greatly reduced with an increase in simple physical activity like walking or running.

## Project Description
### Device Used
M5 Stack Core 2 Module
### Software Used
Arduino
### Libraries Utilized
M5 Core 2

### Problem Statement
The device's program must take real time input of the orientation and accelaration of the M5 Core 2 device and use it to calculate the steps, accelaration (maximum during the journey) and the distance (in m) moved by the person. The distance moved, maximum acceleration and steps are printed on the screen of the LCD screen of the M5 Stack Core2 module. Also, a button is programmed on the device which would reset everything when pressed.
